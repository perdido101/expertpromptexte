# Privacy Policy — ExpertPrompt Extension

**Last updated:** February 9, 2026

## Overview

ExpertPrompt is a browser extension that generates expert role prompts for AI chat interfaces. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles user data.

## Data Collection

ExpertPrompt does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data. Specifically:

- **No personal information** is collected (name, email, location, etc.)
- **No browsing history** is accessed or recorded
- **No analytics or tracking** of any kind is used
- **No data is sent** to external servers, APIs, or third parties

## How the Extension Works

All processing happens **entirely locally** within your browser:

- Expert role prompts are generated on-device using built-in templates.
- User preferences (saved presets, prompt history, settings) are stored locally in your browser using the Chrome Storage API (`chrome.storage.local`).
- No network requests are made by the extension at any time.

## Permissions Used

| Permission        | Purpose                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `clipboardWrite`  | Allows one-click copying of generated prompts |
| `storage`         | Saves your presets and settings locally        |

These permissions are the minimum required for the extension to function. Neither permission involves accessing or transmitting personal data.

## Third-Party Services

ExpertPrompt does **not** use any third-party services, SDKs, or libraries that collect data.

## Changes to This Policy

If this privacy policy is updated, the changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date. No retroactive changes will be made that reduce your privacy protections.
